## Description
This application enables users to interact with a MySQL database through a convenient command-line interface. Users can view and add departments, roles, and employees effortlessly. Additionally, they can easily update an employee's role. The application presents data in formatted tables for departments, roles, and employees, facilitating efficient database management. Adding a department requires the name, adding a role requires the name, salary, and department, and adding an employee requires the first and last names, role, and manager. To update an employee's role, the user selects the employee and enters the new role.
